Project Description:Analyse all kinds of data for a TV series
 Work Summary:
 Issue 1:Creation on Interactive plot.
  Status: Opened into a different tab instead of opening in the same page, so not committed.
  
 Issue 2: Display of Seasons and Episodes having IMDB more than that specified by user.
  Status: Implemented logically but requires formatting and proper presentation. Am still working on it while having sent a Pull Request to the mentor.
  
  I want to thank my mentor and will submit the half-resolved issues which I couldn't work on due to lack of time.
  Thanks.
